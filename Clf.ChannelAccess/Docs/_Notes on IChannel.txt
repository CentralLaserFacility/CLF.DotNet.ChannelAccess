Simple scenario : GetOrCreate() returns new instance ...

  IChannelWrapper   --------->    IConcreteChannel

                                  This might be ...
                                    RemoteChannel
                                    LocalChannel
                                    InvalidChannel

With a 2nd GetOrGCreate(), we'll have multiple references 
to the same underlying Channel instance ...

  IChannelWrapper   ------------+
                                 \
                                  IConcreteChannel   
                                 /
  IChannelWrapper   ------------+


========================

Typically we'll install our IChannel into a ChannelsHandler.

This maintains a dictionary of IChannel-to-ActiveChannelDescriptor pairs.
An ActiveChannelHandler maintains a reference to an IConcreteChannel,

When the ChannelsHandler receives an incoming message regarding a
connection status change or a value change, that message will be from 
an IConcreteChannel. That concrete channel may or may not be one that's referred to
by a ChannelWrapper instance that has been installed into the ChannelsHandler.
In order to react to the incoming message, we have to scan through the ActiveChannelDescriptor
instances and for the IChannelWrapper that it's holding, see whether the WrappedChannel it refers to
is the IConcreteChannel that issued the change.

A simple search would be fine, but performance could be improved if we built a dictionary that gets us from
an IWrappedChannel to the IChannelWrapper.
