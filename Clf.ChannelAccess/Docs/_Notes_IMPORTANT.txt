IMPORTANT :

  Namespaces / assemblies

    Clf.Common 
      Utilities
      Logging

    Clf.ChannelAccess
      interface IChannel
      class ChannelsHub
        .GetOrCreateChannel()
        .PutValueAsync()
      static class Helpers
      class PvValueInfo ... etc
      [ lots of other classes can be 'internal' ]

    Other assemblies ...
    Clf.PvAccess ???
    Clf.BlazorUI ???

  Logging !!!
    Ordinary events, for tracing and debugging interactions with IOC's
    Errors of various kinds ...

  CHANNEL LIFETIME !!! 
    IChannel is IDisposable ... necessary to release resources,
    but maybe better to just do this with a final call to a ChannelsHub method ???
    So IChannel would not be IDisposable, no need for 'using' ...
    But maybe that's an argument for having multiple ChannelsHub instances,
    where each 'hub' would manage a collection of PV's ???
